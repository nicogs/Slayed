During my career, I had to edit quite a few videos and I discovered the wonders of film slate. also known as a movieclapper. We all know it, but did you know how useful it is? 

One of the biggest mistakes I made when recording myself, was restart a recording with every mistake I made. I ended up with so many video files which made the editing workflow a hell. Keeping track of which recording contained a good one and for which part of my video I would need it, was very hard. 

This is why I created a digital film slate for content creators: Slayed. Once you have sorted out what you want to say, cut it up in scenes, you can sit in front of your camera and press record. Open up Slayed and set the desired scene, and start a new reel. Show Slayed to the camera while it countdowns for 3 seconds. 

Made a mistake? No worries, let’s keep the cameras rolling and simply click on “new take” on Slayed. When ready click start take and hold it in front of your camera again.

Recorded a good take after a few warm ups? Awesome! Click on “new take” and make sure to click the “Last Clip Good Take” before starting a new take. 

When you load in your footage, the fist thing you should do is trim your clip so that your footage starts when you are showing your Slayed as it shows 00:00:000 on the right timing. Now take your Slayed and open up the overview. Here you can see which takes of what scene every recording contains.

If you correctly trimmed your footage, you can easily find where the takes for each scenes start and where the good ones are. No need for scrubbing and replaying your footage relentlessly to find that one good take, ever again!
